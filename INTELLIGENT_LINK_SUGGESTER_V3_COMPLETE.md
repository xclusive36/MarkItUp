await api.ui.showModal(
  'Link Suggestions',
  <LinkSuggestionsPanel
    noteName={note.name}
    suggestions={suggestions}
    onAccept={(s) => handleAccept(s)}
    onReject={(s) => handleReject(s)}

  />
);
```

### Step 3: Update the Plugin
The integration guide (`intelligent-link-suggester-ui-integration.tsx`) provides:
- Complete example functions
- Helper utilities
- Learning system implementation
- Ready-to-copy code

## 📊 Before vs After

### Finding Link Opportunities

**Before v3.0:**
```
User presses Cmd+Shift+L
→ Console shows text: "Found 5 suggestions..."
→ User manually reviews console
→ User manually adds [[links]]
→ No preview available
```

**After v3.0:**
```
User presses Cmd+Shift+L
→ Beautiful modal appears
→ 5 suggestions with confidence stars
→ Accept/Reject buttons for each
→ Preview button loads note content
→ Stats show: 0 accepted, 0 rejected, 2 bidirectional
→ One click to accept
→ Link automatically inserted
```

### Bridge Note Suggestions

**Before v3.0:**
```
→ Console output with text
→ User manually creates note
→ No visualization
```

**After v3.0:**
```
→ Professional panel with:
  - Visual cluster diagram
  - "Would improve connectivity by 67%"
  - Complete outline preview
  - Suggested tags and links
  - One click: "Create Bridge Note"
→ Note created automatically
```

### Connection Map

**Before v3.0:**
```
→ Text list in console
→ No visual representation
→ Hard to understand
```

**After v3.0:**
```
→ Dashboard showing:
  - Big numbers: 50 notes, 75 links, 1.5 avg
  - Hub notes with progress bars
  - Orphan notes (10 found)
  - Health score: 75%
  - Recommendations list
→ Click "Find Links" on any orphan
```

## 🎨 Design Highlights

## 💡 Key Innovations

### 1. Pattern Learning System
```typescript
// Tracks decisions
acceptedLinks: [{ source, target, confidence, timestamp }]
rejectedLinks: [{ source, target, confidence, timestamp }]

// Learns patterns
if (suggestion rejected 3+ times) {
  filter from future suggestions
}
```

### 2. Smart Filtering
- Excludes existing links
- Applies user learning
- Respects confidence threshold
- Checks bidirectionality
