## üöÄ How to Use

### For Users:

1. **View Analytics:**
   - Run: `Show Analytics Dashboard` command
   - View health score, growth trends, and top notes
   - Click "Close" to dismiss

2. **Apply Connection Suggestions:**
   - Run: `Discover Hidden Connections` command
   - Review suggestions in interactive modal
   - Filter by confidence threshold
   - Apply individually or use "Apply All"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

1. **Visual Graph Highlighting (Not Yet Implemented)**
   - Suggested connections not yet rendered in KnowledgeMap.tsx
   - Dashed lines for suggestions not implemented
   - Hover tooltips not added to graph
   - **Status:** Deferred to Phase 2
   - **Effort:** 2-3 hours
   - **Priority:** Medium

2. **Two-Way Communication**
   - Modals dispatch events but don't directly call plugin methods
   - Plugin must listen for events from modals
   - Could be improved with direct callbacks

3. **Error Handling**
   - Basic try/catch in place
   - No user-facing error messages yet
   - Could add toast notifications

---

## üîÆ Future Enhancements (Optional)

- [ ] Modify KnowledgeMap.tsx to accept suggestion prop
- [ ] Render suggested connections as dashed lines
- [ ] Color-code by confidence (green/yellow/orange)
- [ ] Add hover tooltips with reasoning
- [ ] Implement click-to-apply from graph

### Phase 3 - Advanced Features (3-5 hours):
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for modals
- [ ] Search/filter within suggestions
- [ ] Export suggestions to different formats
- [ ] Import previously saved suggestions
- [ ] Suggestion history and tracking

### Phase 4 - Polish (1-2 hours):
- [ ] Toast notifications for actions
- [ ] Loading spinners for async operations
- [ ] Error messages with retry buttons
- [ ] Tutorial/onboarding for first-time users
