## 🎯 Design Decisions

### Why These Features?

**1. Live Preview**
- **Problem:** Users had to click "Apply" to see changes
- **Solution:** Preview tab with real-time updates
- **Benefit:** Instant feedback, faster iteration

**2. Undo/Redo**
- **Problem:** No way to undo accidental changes
- **Solution:** Full history tracking with keyboard shortcuts
- **Benefit:** Safe experimentation, confidence to try bold changes

**3. Toast Notifications**
- **Problem:** `alert()` dialogs block UI and feel jarring
- **Solution:** Non-blocking toast notifications
- **Benefit:** Smooth workflow, professional feel

### Why Not Other Features?

**Color Harmony Generator** (Priority 2)
- Good idea, but adds complexity
- Can be added in v2.1 if users request it

**Cloud Sync** (Priority 3)
- Requires backend infrastructure
- Out of scope for v2.0
- Future consideration for v3.0

**AI Suggestions** (Priority 3)
- Requires AI API integration
- Expensive to run
- Better as paid feature in future
