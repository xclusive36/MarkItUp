## 🎓 Usage Tips

### Best Practices

1. **Select quality content** - Well-written paragraphs work best
2. **Review AI cards** - Edit before indexing if needed
3. **Use subtags** - Organize with `#flashcard/topic`
4. **Combine methods** - Manual + AI for best results
5. **Try different providers** - Claude often best for education

### Common Workflows

**Quick Capture:**
```
During lecture → Quick Q: only
After class → Run "Complete Answers"
→ Review and index
```

**Deep Study:**
```
Read material → Take notes
→ Generate from full note (Cmd+Alt+G)
→ Review AI cards
→ Index and study
```

**Focused Learning:**
```
Identify hard section → Select text
→ Generate cards (Cmd+Shift+G)
→ Add manual cards if needed
→ Study immediately
```
