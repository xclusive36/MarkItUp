## 📝 Plugin 3: Content Outliner & Expander

**ID:** `ai-content-outliner-expander`
**Version:** 1.0.0

### What It Does
Transform bullet points into full paragraphs and vice versa using AI. Perfect for writers who outline first and expand later, or need to compress long text into concise points.

### Key Features
- ✅ **Expand Selection** (Cmd+Shift+E) - Convert bullet points to paragraphs
- ✅ **Compress to Bullets** (Cmd+Shift+B) - Convert paragraphs to bullet points
- ✅ **Generate Draft from Outline** - Transform entire outline into full article
- ✅ **Expand Section** - Expand current section only
- ✅ **Suggest Structure Improvements** - AI analyzes document organization

### Settings
- **Writing Style**: Professional, Casual, Academic, Technical, Creative
- **Expansion Depth**: Brief (1-2 sentences), Moderate (1 paragraph), Comprehensive (2-3 paragraphs), Detailed (full section)
- **Target Word Count**: Set specific word count goals (0 = automatic)
- **Include Examples**: Add examples and analogies when expanding
- **Preserve Structure**: Keep original heading hierarchy

### Use Cases

#### For Writers
```markdown
Before (Outline):
- Character development is crucial
- Plot must have clear arc
- Setting establishes mood

After (Expanded):
Character development is crucial to creating memorable stories. Readers connect with 
well-developed characters who grow and change throughout the narrative. By investing 
time in understanding your characters' motivations, fears, and desires, you create 
authentic personalities that resonate with your audience.

The plot must have a clear arc that guides readers through the story. A well-structured 
narrative includes rising action, climax, and resolution...
```

#### For Researchers
```markdown
Before (Dense paragraphs):
[Long academic text about quantum computing...]

After (Compressed):
- Quantum computing uses qubits instead of classical bits
- Superposition allows simultaneous states
- Entanglement enables quantum parallelism
- Current limitations: decoherence and error rates
```

## 🗺️ Plugin 4: Knowledge Graph Auto-Mapper

**ID:** `ai-knowledge-graph-auto-mapper`
**Version:** 1.0.0

### What It Does
Enhances the existing knowledge graph with AI-powered insights. Discovers hidden connections, suggests organization, and helps structure your notes intelligently.

### Key Features
- ✅ **Discover Hidden Connections** (Cmd+Shift+D) - Find semantic links AI detects
- ✅ **Analyze & Name Clusters** - AI names groups of related notes
- ✅ **Suggest MOCs** - Recommend Maps of Content (hub notes) to create
- ✅ **Find Bridge Notes** - Identify topics that would connect isolated clusters
- ✅ **Connect Orphan Notes** - Suggest connections for isolated notes
- ✅ **Graph Health Check** - Comprehensive graph analysis with metrics

### Settings
- **Auto-Discover Connections**: Automatically suggest when notes change
- **Minimum Similarity Score**: Threshold for connection suggestions (0-1)
- **Minimum Cluster Size**: Notes required to form a cluster
- **Suggest MOCs**: Auto-suggest creating hub notes
- **Categorize Relationships**: AI labels link types (supports, contradicts, extends)

### How It Works with Existing Graph

The Knowledge Graph Auto-Mapper **enhances** the existing D3.js knowledge graph:

```
Existing Graph Features        +  AI Enhancement
────────────────────────          ─────────────────────
Shows wikilinks                   + Finds semantic connections
Displays backlinks                + Suggests missing links
Visualizes clusters               + Names & describes clusters
Finds orphan notes                + Suggests how to connect them
Interactive navigation            + Categorizes relationship types
                                  + Recommends MOCs
                                  + Auto-organizes structure
```

### Example Outputs

#### Hidden Connections
```
🔗 Hidden Connections Discovered:

1. "Machine Learning Basics" ↔ "Neural Networks Deep Dive"
   Similarity: 89%
   Reason: Both discuss backpropagation and gradient descent

2. "Project Planning" ↔ "Time Management Techniques"
   Similarity: 76%
   Reason: Shared concepts of task prioritization and scheduling
```

#### Cluster Analysis
```
🗂️ Cluster Analysis:

1. Machine Learning Fundamentals (12 notes)
   Theme: Introduction to ML concepts, algorithms, and applications
   Topics: supervised learning, neural networks, deep learning, optimization

2. Personal Development (8 notes)
   Theme: Self-improvement strategies and productivity techniques
   Topics: habits, goal-setting, time-management, mindfulness
```

#### MOC Suggestions
```
📚 MOC (Map of Content) Suggestions:

1. Create MOC: "Machine Learning Overview" [high priority]
   Would connect: Neural Networks, Backpropagation, CNN, RNN, Transformers...
   Reason: These 12 notes form a coherent learning path that would benefit from a central index

2. Create MOC: "Web Development Stack" [medium priority]
   Would connect: React, Node.js, MongoDB, Express, REST APIs...
   Reason: Technology stack components that are frequently used together
```

#### Bridge Notes
```
🌉 Bridge Note Suggestions:

1. "Applied Machine Learning in Web Development"
   Connects: "Machine Learning Fundamentals" ↔ "Web Development Stack"
   Why: Several ML concepts (recommendation systems, NLP) are commonly used in web applications

2. "Productivity for Developers"
   Connects: "Personal Development" ↔ "Web Development Stack"
   Why: Time management and focus techniques specifically for coding work
```

#### Orphan Connections
```
🏝️ Orphan Note Connection Suggestions:

1. "Introduction to Rust"
   Suggested links:
   - [[Systems Programming]]: Both discuss low-level memory management
   - [[Performance Optimization]]: Rust's zero-cost abstractions
   - [[Web Assembly]]: Rust compiles to WASM

2. "Coffee Brewing Methods"
   Suggested links:
   - [[Morning Routines]]: Part of daily ritual
   - [[Kitchen Equipment]]: Brewing tools and setup
```

#### Health Check
```
