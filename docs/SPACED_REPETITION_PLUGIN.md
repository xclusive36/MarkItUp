## üéØ The FSRS Algorithm

### What is FSRS?

FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) is a modern, scientifically-validated algorithm that:

- Predicts memory stability and retrievability
- Calculates optimal review intervals
- Adapts to your individual learning patterns
- Outperforms traditional SM-2 algorithm (used in Anki before v23)

### Card States

**üÜï New** - Never reviewed before
- First review available immediately
- Moved to Learning after first review

**üìö Learning** - Recently introduced
- Short intervals (minutes to days)
- Requires multiple successful reviews

**‚úÖ Review** - Successfully learned
- Long intervals (days to months)
- Mature cards

**üîÑ Relearning** - Forgotten and being relearned
- Shorter intervals than Review
- Returns to Review after successful reviews

### Rating System

After seeing the answer, rate how well you remembered:

**1 - Again** (Red)
- Completely forgot
- Card resets to Learning/Relearning
- Very short interval (< 10 minutes)

**2 - Hard** (Orange)
- Struggled to remember
- Shorter interval than normal
- Card difficulty increases

**3 - Good** (Green)
- Remembered correctly
- Standard interval increase
- Most common rating

**4 - Easy** (Blue)
- Instantly recalled
- Longer interval than normal
- Card difficulty decreases

### Scheduling Parameters

The algorithm tracks these metrics per card:

- **Stability** - How long the memory lasts
- **Difficulty** - Intrinsic card difficulty (1-10)
- **Retrievability** - Current recall probability
- **Interval** - Days until next review
- **Lapses** - Times forgotten
- **Reps** - Total reviews

- Progress bars showing proportions

### Additional Details
- **Average Ease** - Average difficulty (inverse)
- **Total Reviews** - Lifetime review count
- **Last Review** - Most recent review date

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings

### Auto-Index on Save
**Default:** `true`

Automatically detect and index flashcards when saving notes.

- **Enabled**: New flashcards indexed automatically
- **Disabled**: Manual indexing required (Cmd+Shift+F)

### Daily Review Limit
**Default:** `20`

Maximum number of cards to review per day.

- Prevents overwhelming review sessions
- Balances learning and retention

### New Cards Per Day
**Default:** `10`

Maximum new cards introduced per day.

- Controls learning pace
- Prevents information overload

### Target Retention Rate
**Default:** `90%`

Target percentage of correct recalls.

- Affects interval calculations
- Higher = shorter intervals (more reviews)
- Lower = longer intervals (fewer reviews)

### Show Context in Review
**Default:** `true`

Display surrounding note content during review.

- Helps with contextual learning
- Useful for complex topics
- Can be toggled if distracting

## üéØ Best Practices

### Creating Effective Flashcards

**1. Atomic Concepts**
‚ùå Bad: `Q: What are OOP and FP? A: Object-Oriented and Functional Programming`
‚úÖ Good: Two separate cards for each concept

**2. Clear Questions**
‚ùå Bad: `Q: What about React? A: It's a library`
‚úÖ Good: `Q: What is React? A: A JavaScript library for building UIs`

**3. Use Context**
Link related notes with [[wikilinks]] and ^block-ids

**4. Consistent Formatting**
Use Q: A: format for clarity and reliable parsing

**5. Organize with Subtags**
`#flashcard/topic` groups related cards

### Review Strategies

**Daily Routine**
- Review at the same time daily
- Start with due cards, then new cards
- Aim for your daily limits (don't overdo it)

**Rating Honestly**
- **Again** - Only if you truly forgot
- **Hard** - If you struggled or hesitated
- **Good** - Your default for correct recalls
- **Easy** - Only if instant and effortless

**Managing Difficulty**
- Difficult cards appear more frequently
- Easy cards space out quickly
- The algorithm adapts to you

**Maintaining Streaks**
- Review at least one card daily
- Short sessions are better than skipping
- Use statistics to track progress

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Flashcards Not Detected

**Problem:** Indexed but no cards found

**Solutions:**
- Check `#flashcard` tag is present
- Ensure Q: and A: format is correct (colon + space)
- Try manual indexing (Cmd+Shift+F)
- Check browser console for errors

### Reviews Not Scheduling

**Problem:** Cards not appearing when due

**Solutions:**
- Check Statistics Dashboard (are there due cards?)
- Verify cards aren't in "New" state (need first review)
- Clear browser cache and re-index
- Check daily limits in settings

### Poor Retention Rate

**Problem:** Forgetting too many cards

**Solutions:**
- Review more honestly (use "Hard" when struggling)
- Create simpler, more atomic cards
- Add more context to complex cards
- Review daily for consistency
- Lower target retention rate (easier intervals)

### Database Issues

**Problem:** Data not persisting

**Solutions:**
- Check browser supports IndexedDB
- Clear site data and re-index
- Export cards before clearing (coming soon)
- Disable incognito/private mode

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

### Integration with AI Features

Use MarkItUp's AI providers to:

**Generate Flashcards:**
```markdown
[[Note Content]]

AI: Generate flashcards from this content #flashcard/ai-generated
```

**Improve Cards:**
Ask AI to:
- Simplify complex questions
- Add context to answers
- Create cloze deletions
- Generate related cards

### Bulk Operations

**Index All Notes:**
Run "Index All Notes for Flashcards" command

**Benefits:**
- Import existing notes as flashcards
- Quickly build large decks
- Find cards you forgot to tag

**Note:** This may take time for large vaults (100+ notes)

### Block References Deep Dive

**Why use ^block-ids:**
- Precise references to specific content
- Navigate directly from flashcard to source
- Update source without breaking references

**Example:**
```markdown
# Main Note

Key concept here. ^key-concept

# Flashcard Note

Q: What's the key concept? A: See [[Main Note#^key-concept]] #flashcard
```

## üìà Performance & Limits

**Tested Limits:**
- 10,000+ cards indexed successfully
- 100+ cards reviewed per session
- Minimal performance impact on note rendering
- IndexedDB storage: ~50MB typical usage

**Recommendations:**
- Keep daily limits reasonable (20-30 cards)
- Index notes incrementally, not all at once
- Use subtags for large decks (easier filtering)
- Regular reviews better than cramming
