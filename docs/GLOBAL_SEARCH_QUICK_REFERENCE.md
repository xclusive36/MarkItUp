## Troubleshooting

**No results found?**

- Check spelling/try related terms
- Use Semantic mode for concept matching

**Semantic search not working?**
- First search downloads ~25MB model (one-time)
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure IndexedDB is enabled
- Use Keyword mode as fallback

**Saved searches disappeared?**
- Check browser localStorage quota
- Try clearing browser cache and re-saving
- Export important searches (copy queries manually)

**Search too slow?**
- Keyword mode is fastest
- Limit results (default: 50)
- Check number of indexed notes
- Try more specific queries

## Pro Tips

1. **Arrow Keys are Faster:** Use ‚Üë‚Üì instead of clicking through results
2. **Preview Before Opening:** Enable preview to verify content without disrupting workflow
3. **Export for Documentation:** Save search results for research papers or documentation
4. **Sort Strategically:** Use Date for recent work, Folder for projects, Name for known notes
5. **Combine Modes:** Try all three modes + different sorts for comprehensive discovery
6. **Keyboard Only:** Open (Ctrl+Shift+F) ‚Üí Type ‚Üí ‚Üì‚Üì ‚Üí Enter (never touch mouse)

## Best Practices

### For Daily Use
- Use `Ctrl+Shift+F` frequently - it's faster than manual browsing

### For Research
