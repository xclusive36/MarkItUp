## 🆚 When to Use What (v3.1 Edition)

### Readability Metrics vs Flow Analysis

**Use Readability when:**
- Concerned about audience comprehension
- Need specific grade level
- Want quantitative metrics
- Checking for passive voice

**Use Flow Analysis when:**
- Ideas feel disjointed
- Transitions are missing
- Order seems wrong
- Qualitative issues

### Templates vs Manual Structure

**Use Templates when:**
- Starting from scratch
- Need standard format
- Want consistency across documents
- Time-saving is priority

**Manual Structure when:**
- Creative/unique format needed
- Template doesn't fit content
- Already partially structured

### Export vs Don't Export

**Export Reports when:**
- Sharing with team
- Need documentation trail
- Tracking improvement
- Professional deliverable

**Don't Export when:**
- Quick personal check
- Iterating rapidly
- Just need the score

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting v3.1

### "Readability analysis shows 0 words"

**Fix:** Document might be empty or all code blocks. Add regular text.

### "Template doesn't apply correctly"

**Fix:** 
1. Ensure AI is configured
2. Check document has enough content (100+ words)
3. Try different template
4. Preview and edit before applying

### "Auto-export not working"

**Fix:**
1. Check setting is enabled
2. Allow clipboard access in browser
3. Try manual copy button

### "Readability score seems wrong"

**Reason:** 
- Markdown syntax affects counts
- Code blocks skew results
- Very short documents unreliable

**Fix:** Use on prose content >200 words
