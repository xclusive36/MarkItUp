## 💡 Why This Pivot Was Smart

### **Problem with v2.0:**
- Only useful for outliner-first writers (niche)
- Redundant with AI chat (could just ask AI to expand)
- Limited adoption potential

### **Solution with v3.0:**
- Useful for **everyone** who writes
- Does things AI chat **can't** do (document structure analysis)
- Universal need (organizing thoughts is hard!)

**Bottom Line:** You now have a plugin people will actually use! 🎯

It finds flow problems, checks arguments, suggests citations, breaks up  
walls of text, adds headings, detects redundancy, and converts formats.  

**It's like Grammarly for document structure.**"

**That's a game changer.** 🚀
