## 📊 Analytics Details

### Coverage Score Calculation
```
Coverage % = (Notes with Tags / Total Notes) * 100
```

**Interpretation:**
- **80-100%**: Excellent organization
- **60-79%**: Good coverage, some gaps
- **40-59%**: Moderate coverage, consider batch tagging
- **0-39%**: Low coverage, batch tagging recommended

### Acceptance Rate Calculation
```
Acceptance Rate % = (Accepted Suggestions / Total Suggestions) * 100
```

**Interpretation:**
- **70-100%**: AI suggestions are highly relevant
- **50-69%**: AI performing well, minor tuning possible
- **30-49%**: Consider adjusting confidence threshold
- **0-29%**: Reconfigure settings or change AI provider

### Data Storage

All analytics data is stored locally in browser localStorage:
- **Key**: `smart-auto-tagger-analytics`
- **Format**: JSON
- **Privacy**: Never leaves your device
- **Export**: Available via "Export Analytics" command

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: "AI service not available"**
- **Cause**: AI not configured or API key invalid
- **Solution**: Go to Settings → AI, verify configuration, test connection

**Issue: No tags suggested**
- **Cause**: Note content too short, or excluded tags filter
- **Solution**: Write more detailed content, check excluded tags setting

**Issue: Tags applied but disappeared**
- **Cause**: File system sync issue
- **Solution**: Check browser console for errors, reload page

**Issue: Undo not working**
- **Cause**: History cleared or page reloaded
- **Solution**: Undo history is session-based, reloading clears it

**Issue: Analytics not updating**
- **Cause**: Analytics tracking disabled
- **Solution**: Settings → Plugins → Smart Auto-Tagger → Enable Analytics

**Issue: Batch tagging stuck**
- **Cause**: Network error or AI service down
- **Solution**: Use Stop button, check AI service status, retry

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('debug-smart-auto-tagger', 'true');
```

Check console for detailed logs:
- AI API calls
- Tag suggestions
- Analytics updates
- Error stack traces

## 🚦 Best Practices

### 1. **Start with Batch Tagging**
- Tag all existing notes before using incrementally
- Establish baseline for analytics
- Discover common themes in your notes

### 2. **Review and Refine**
- Check analytics dashboard weekly
- Adjust confidence threshold based on acceptance rate
- Add frequently-rejected tags to excluded list

### 3. **Use Undo Liberally**
- Don't worry about mistakes
- Experiment with different tag combinations
- Undo is always available (during same session)

### 4. **Monitor Coverage**
- Aim for 80%+ coverage for searchable knowledge base
- Use "Tag All" button in analytics for orphaned notes
- Review untagged notes manually if auto-tagging fails

### 5. **Organize with Analytics**
- Identify underused tags (consider removing)
- Consolidate similar tags (e.g., #ai vs #artificial-intelligence)
- Track tag evolution over time
