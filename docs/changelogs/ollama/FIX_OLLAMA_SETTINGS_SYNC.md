# Fix: Writing Assistant Not Recognizing Ollama Configuration

## Problem

When a user configured Ollama in the AI Assistant settings and then tried to use the Writing Assistant, they would get an "AI provider not configured" error, even though Ollama was properly set up.

## Root Cause

The API routes (`/api/ai/analyze`, `/api/ai/analyze-knowledge`, `/api/ai/suggest-note`) were calling `getAIService()` on the server side, which tried to load settings from `localStorage`. Since `localStorage` only exists in the browser (not on the server), the server would fall back to default settings with:
- `provider: 'openai'`
- `apiKey: ''`

This would fail the check:
```typescript
if (!settings.apiKey && settings.provider !== 'ollama') {
  return error('AI service not configured');
}
```

## Solution

Modified the client-side components to **pass the AI settings from localStorage to the API** in the request body. The API routes then use these settings to configure the AI service on the server.

### Files Modified

#### 1. `/src/components/WritingAssistant.tsx`
```typescript
// Before
body: JSON.stringify({
  content,
  noteId,
  analysisType: 'full',
})

// After - Load and pass settings
const saved = localStorage.getItem('markitup-ai-settings');
const aiSettings = saved ? JSON.parse(saved) : null;

body: JSON.stringify({
  content,
  noteId,
  analysisType: 'full',
  settings: aiSettings, // Pass to server
})
```

#### 2. `/src/components/KnowledgeDiscovery.tsx`
Updated both `analyzeKnowledgeBase()` and `generateNoteSuggestion()` methods to load and pass settings to their respective API routes.

#### 3. `/src/app/api/ai/analyze/route.ts`
```typescript
// Extract settings from request body
const { ..., settings: clientSettings } = body;

// Use client settings if provided
const aiService = getAIService();
if (clientSettings) {
  aiService.updateSettings(clientSettings);
}
```

#### 4. `/src/app/api/ai/analyze-knowledge/route.ts`
Same pattern as above.

#### 5. `/src/app/api/ai/suggest-note/route.ts`
Same pattern as above.

## How It Works Now

1. **Client Side (Browser):**
   - User configures Ollama in AI settings
   - Settings saved to `localStorage`
   - When user clicks "Analyze Content" or similar:
     - Component reads settings from `localStorage`
     - Sends settings along with request to API

2. **Server Side (API Route):**
   - Receives request with settings
   - Calls `aiService.updateSettings(clientSettings)`
   - This reinitializes the providers with correct configuration
   - Now correctly identifies Ollama and doesn't require API key

## Testing Steps

### 1. Configure Ollama
1. Make sure Ollama is installed and running:
   ```bash
   ollama list  # Should show models
   ollama run llama3.2 "Hello"  # Test it works
   ```

2. In MarkItUp:
   - Click Brain icon (ðŸ§ ) in header
   - Go to Settings tab
   - Select "Ollama (Local) - No API Key Needed!"
   - Enter model name: `llama3.2`
   - Save settings

### 2. Test Writing Assistant
1. Create or open a note with some content
2. Click the PenTool icon to open Writing Assistant
3. Click "Analyze Content"
4. **Expected:** Should work and show AI analysis
5. **Previously:** Would show "AI provider not configured" error

### 3. Test Knowledge Discovery
1. Click Compass icon to open Knowledge Discovery
2. Click "Start Analysis"
3. **Expected:** Should analyze knowledge base and show gaps
4. **Previously:** Would show configuration error

### 4. Test Note Suggestions
1. In Knowledge Discovery, after analysis
2. Click on any missing topic to generate note suggestion
3. **Expected:** Should generate AI-powered note content
4. **Previously:** Would show setup guide instead of actual suggestion

## Benefits

âœ… **All AI features now work with Ollama** - No more configuration errors
âœ… **Consistent experience** - Settings configured once work everywhere
âœ… **No breaking changes** - Existing cloud provider configurations still work
âœ… **Proper error handling** - If settings aren't configured, helpful messages still shown

## Technical Notes

### Why Not Use Cookies or Server-Side Storage?

We considered several approaches:

1. **Cookies:** Would work but adds complexity and has size limits
2. **Server-side storage:** Next.js API routes are stateless/serverless
3. **Environment variables:** User-specific settings can't be in .env

**Chosen Solution:** Pass settings in request body
- Simple and straightforward
- Works in all deployment scenarios
- No server-side storage needed
- Settings stay client-side (better for privacy)

### Alternative Approaches for Future

For a production app with many users, consider:
- Database storage with user authentication
- Encrypted cookies for settings
- Session management system

For this personal knowledge management tool, passing settings in requests is appropriate.

## Verification

Run development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Check browser console for any errors when using AI features with Ollama configured.
