# AI Chat Context Fix

## Issue
The AI Chat component was not recognizing the current note context. When users asked about their open note, the AI responded with "I don't see any notes added to your MarkItUp system yet."

## Root Cause
The `noteContext` (current note ID) was being sent from the frontend to the API, but the server-side API route wasn't reading the actual note content from the file system. The AI service was trying to use a PKM system that was only initialized client-side and not available server-side.

## Solution

### 1. Updated API Route (`src/app/api/ai/route.ts`)
- Added import of `findNoteById` from file helpers
- Before processing the AI request, check if `noteContext` is provided
- Read the note content from the file system using `findNoteById()`
- Inject the note content into the message as context
- For Ollama: Add context to system prompt
- For other providers: Prepend context to user message

**Key Changes:**
```typescript
// Build context from note if noteContext is provided
let contextMessage = '';
if (body.noteContext && body.includeContext !== false) {
  const note = findNoteById(body.noteContext);
  if (note) {
    contextMessage = `\n\n[Current Note Context: "${note.name}"]\n${note.content.slice(0, 1500)}\n[End of Note Context]\n\n`;
  }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced UI (`src/components/AIChat.tsx`)
- Added visual indicator showing which note is in context
- Updated empty state message to guide users:
  - Shows different message when note is open vs. not
  - Displays quick command hints
  - Shows "üìù Note context active" badge when note is open
- Added context indicator in header showing the note name

**Visual Improvements:**
- Header now shows: "Context: Note [filename]" when a note is open
- Empty state explains the context feature
- Quick command suggestions displayed prominently

## Files Modified
1. `src/app/api/ai/route.ts` - Added note context injection
2. `src/components/AIChat.tsx` - Added UI indicators for context

## Testing
To verify the fix works:

1. **Open a note** in MarkItUp
2. **Open AI Chat** (Brain icon in header)
3. **Check header** - Should show "Context: Note [filename]"
4. **Ask about the note**: "What is this note about?" or "Summarize this note"
5. **AI should respond** with information about the actual note content

## Quick Commands Still Work
All the PKM-specific commands still work as designed:
- `/connections` - Finds related notes
- `/gaps` - Identifies knowledge gaps
- `/tag` - Suggests tags
- `/link` - Suggests wikilinks
- `/expand <text>` - Expands content
- `/summarize` - Summarizes note
- `/help` - Shows command list

## Benefits
1. **Context-Aware Conversations**: AI now has access to current note
2. **Better User Experience**: Clear visual feedback about context
3. **Accurate Responses**: AI can answer questions about specific notes
4. **Seamless Integration**: Works with all AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama)

## Technical Notes
- Context is limited to first 1500 characters to avoid token limits
- Context is only included when `includeContext !== false`
- Falls back gracefully if note cannot be found
- Works on server-side (API routes have file system access)
