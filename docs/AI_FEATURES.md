# AI Integration Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up AI features in your MarkItUp PKM system.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Get an OpenAI API Key

1. Visit [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the API key (starts with `sk-`)

### 2. Configure AI in MarkItUp

1. Open MarkItUp in your browser
2. Click the Brain icon (üß†) in the top header
3. Click the Settings gear icon in the AI chat panel
4. Paste your OpenAI API key
5. Choose your preferred model:
   - **GPT-3.5 Turbo**: Fast and cost-effective (recommended for most users)
   - **GPT-4**: Most capable but more expensive
   - **GPT-4 Turbo**: Balanced option with larger context window

### 3. Start Chatting!

- Ask questions about your notes
- Get help with writing and editing
- Request summaries of your content
- Find connections between ideas

## üß† AI Features

### Context-Aware Conversations

The AI assistant automatically includes relevant context from your knowledge base:

- **Related Notes**: When discussing a specific note, related notes are included
- **Search Integration**: Your search results help inform AI responses
- **Wikilink Awareness**: The AI understands your note connections
- **Tag Recognition**: AI considers your tagging system

### Smart Suggestions

- **Writing Help**: Get suggestions for improving your content
- **Tag Recommendations**: AI suggests relevant tags for your notes
- **Connection Discovery**: Find potential links between your notes
- **Content Expansion**: Generate ideas to develop your thoughts

### Knowledge Graph Integration

- **Graph-Based Context**: AI uses your knowledge graph structure
- **Backlink Analysis**: Considers bidirectional connections
- **Orphan Note Detection**: Helps connect isolated notes
- **Hub Identification**: Recognizes your most connected notes

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Basic Settings

- **API Key**: Your OpenAI API key (required)
- **Model**: Choose between GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, or GPT-4 Turbo
- **Temperature**: Control creativity (0 = focused, 1 = creative)
- **Max Tokens**: Limit response length (default: 1000)

### Context Settings

- **Enable Context**: Include note context in conversations (recommended)
- **Max Context Notes**: Number of related notes to include (default: 5)
- **Context Search Depth**: How deep to search for relevant content

### Usage Tracking

- **Enable Usage Tracking**: Monitor token usage and costs
- **Monthly Limit**: Set spending limits to control costs

## üí∞ Cost Management

### Understanding Costs

- **GPT-3.5 Turbo**: ~$0.001 per 1,000 tokens (very affordable)
- **GPT-4**: ~$0.03 per 1,000 tokens (premium pricing)
- **GPT-4 Turbo**: ~$0.01 per 1,000 tokens (balanced)

### Cost-Saving Tips

1. **Start with GPT-3.5 Turbo** for most tasks
2. **Use GPT-4 only when needed** for complex reasoning
3. **Enable usage tracking** to monitor spending
4. **Set monthly limits** to avoid surprises
5. **Use context wisely** - more context = more tokens

### Token Estimation

- Average conversation: 100-500 tokens
- Note analysis: 200-1000 tokens
- With context: +100-300 tokens per note included

## üîí Privacy & Security

### Data Handling

- **API Key Storage**: Encrypted locally in your browser
- **Conversation History**: Stored locally, not on external servers
- **Note Content**: Only sent to OpenAI when explicitly included in context
- **No Automatic Sharing**: Your notes are not automatically processed

### Best Practices

1. **Review Context Settings**: Choose what information to share
2. **Use Local Models**: Consider Ollama for sensitive content (future feature)
3. **Regular Cleanup**: Delete old conversations you no longer need
4. **Monitor Usage**: Keep track of what data is being sent

## üõ† Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"AI not configured" Error**
- Ensure you've entered a valid OpenAI API key
- Check that your API key hasn't expired
- Verify your OpenAI account has available credits

**Slow Responses**
- Try switching to GPT-3.5 Turbo for faster responses
- Reduce the number of context notes included
- Check your internet connection

**High Costs**
- Monitor your usage in the AI settings
- Switch to a more cost-effective model
- Reduce context inclusion for routine tasks

**No Context in Responses**
- Ensure "Include note context" is enabled
- Check that you have related notes in your knowledge base
- Verify the AI can find relevant connections

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify your API key is correctly entered
3. Test with a simple question first
4. Review your OpenAI account status
