# Spaced Repetition Plugin v1.1 - AI Integration Complete! ü§ñ

## üéâ Phase 2 Complete: AI-Powered Flashcard Generation

The Spaced Repetition plugin now includes **AI-powered flashcard generation** that works with all 4 AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and Ollama)!

## ‚ú® New Features (v1.1)

### 1. üéØ AI Generation from Selection
**Keyboard Shortcut:** `Cmd+Shift+G`

Generate flashcards from any selected text in your notes.

**How it works:**
1. Select text in your note (paragraph, section, or any content)
2. Press `Cmd+Shift+G` or run "AI: Generate Flashcards from Selection"
3. AI analyzes the text and creates 3-5 Q&A flashcard pairs
4. Flashcards are automatically inserted into your note
5. Press `Cmd+Shift+F` to index them for review

**Example:**
```markdown
<!-- Original note content -->
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
It uses a component-based architecture and virtual DOM for efficient updates.

<!-- After AI generation -->
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
It uses a component-based architecture and virtual DOM for efficient updates.

## üéì Generated Flashcards

Q: What is React? A: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces #flashcard
Q: What architecture does React use? A: Component-based architecture #flashcard
Q: What does React use for efficient updates? A: Virtual DOM #flashcard
```

### 2. üìö AI Generation from Entire Note
**Keyboard Shortcut:** `Cmd+Alt+G`

Analyze an entire note and generate comprehensive flashcards.

**How it works:**
1. Open any note with content
2. Press `Cmd+Alt+G` or run "AI: Generate Flashcards from Note"
3. AI reads the entire note and identifies key concepts
4. Creates 5-10 flashcards covering the most important topics
5. Appends flashcards to the end of the note with special tag `#flashcard/ai-generated`

**Best for:**
- Long-form notes with multiple topics
- Study guides and lecture notes
- Technical documentation
- Research papers

### 3. üîß AI Answer Completion
**Command:** "AI: Complete Missing Answers"

Automatically fill in missing answers for incomplete flashcards.

**How it works:**
1. Create question-only flashcards: `Q: What is TypeScript? #flashcard`
2. Run "AI: Complete Missing Answers" command
3. AI reads note context and generates appropriate answers
4. Updates flashcards: `Q: What is TypeScript? A: A typed superset of JavaScript #flashcard`

**Perfect for:**
- Quick capture during lectures (questions now, answers later)
- Review and enhancement of flashcard decks
- Ensuring completeness before study sessions

## üéÆ Usage Examples

### Example 1: Study Session Workflow

```markdown
# Biology - Cell Structure

The cell membrane is a selective barrier that controls what enters and leaves the cell.
Mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell, producing ATP through cellular respiration.
The nucleus contains DNA and controls cell activities.

<!-- Select the above text, press Cmd+Shift+G -->

## üéì Generated Flashcards

Q: What is the function of the cell membrane? A: A selective barrier that controls what enters and leaves the cell #flashcard
Q: What are mitochondria known as? A: The powerhouse of the cell #flashcard
Q: What does the nucleus contain? A: DNA #flashcard
Q: What process do mitochondria use to produce ATP? A: Cellular respiration #flashcard
```

### Example 2: Quick Capture ‚Üí AI Complete

```markdown
# React Hooks Study

<!-- During lecture, quickly capture questions -->
Q: What does useState return? #flashcard
Q: When does useEffect run? #flashcard
Q: What's the difference between useMemo and useCallback? #flashcard

<!-- After class, run "AI: Complete Missing Answers" -->

Q: What does useState return? A: An array with [state, setState] #flashcard
Q: When does useEffect run? A: After every render by default (unless dependencies specified) #flashcard
Q: What's the difference between useMemo and useCallback? A: useMemo memoizes values, useCallback memoizes functions #flashcard
```

### Example 3: Comprehensive Note Analysis

```markdown
# Machine Learning Fundamentals

<!-- Long note with 2000+ words about ML concepts -->
...content about supervised learning, neural networks, backpropagation, etc...

<!-- Press Cmd+Alt+G to analyze entire note -->

## üìä Generation Quality

**What makes AI-generated flashcards high-quality:**

1. **Context-Aware:** Uses note title and content for relevant questions
2. **Concept-Focused:** Targets key ideas, not trivial details
3. **Clear Questions:** Specific, unambiguous wording
4. **Complete Answers:** Accurate, sufficient information
5. **Atomic:** One concept per flashcard (optimal for SRS)

**Tips for better results:**
- Select focused passages (1-2 paragraphs)
- Use notes with clear, well-written content
- Review and edit generated cards before studying
- Provide context with note titles and structure

## üîß Technical Details

### AI Prompt Engineering

The plugin uses carefully crafted prompts:

**For selection generation:**
```
Generate flashcards from this text. Create 3-5 high-quality Q&A pairs 
that test understanding of the key concepts.

Requirements:
- Clear, specific questions
- Complete, accurate answers
- Focus on important concepts
- One concept per flashcard
- Format: Q: [question] A: [answer]
```

**For note analysis:**
```
Analyze this note and generate 5-10 high-quality flashcards covering 
the most important concepts and facts.

Focus on:
- Key concepts and definitions
- Important facts and relationships
- Critical understanding points
```

**For answer completion:**
```
Given this flashcard question, provide a clear, accurate answer.
Context: [note name and snippet]
Provide only the answer, no extra text.
```

### Response Parsing

The plugin intelligently parses AI responses:
- Detects `Q: ... A: ...` format
- Handles variations in spacing and punctuation
- Strips unnecessary text and formatting
- Validates question-answer pairs

### Error Handling

Robust error handling ensures smooth operation:
- Checks AI availability before generation
- Validates selection/note content
- Provides clear error messages
- Falls back gracefully on API failures

## üìà Performance & Limits

**Generation Speed:**
- Selection (3-5 cards): ~5-10 seconds
- Full note (5-10 cards): ~10-20 seconds
- Answer completion (per card): ~3-5 seconds

**Recommendations:**
- Generate in batches (don't overload one note)
- Review and edit AI cards before indexing
- Use subtags to organize AI-generated content
- Combine manual and AI-generated flashcards

**Token Usage:**
- Selection generation: ~500-1000 tokens
- Note analysis: ~1000-3000 tokens
- Answer completion: ~200-500 tokens per card

**Cost Estimates (with paid APIs):**
- OpenAI GPT-4: ~$0.01-0.05 per note
- Anthropic Claude: ~$0.01-0.03 per note
- Google Gemini: ~$0.001-0.01 per note
- Ollama: **$0.00** (completely free!)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "AI not configured"
**Solution:** Go to Settings ‚Üí AI Settings ‚Üí Configure your AI provider and API key (or use Ollama for free local AI)

### "No flashcards generated"
**Possible causes:**
- Selected text too short or unclear
- AI response didn't match expected format
- API error or timeout

**Solutions:**
- Select more substantial text (at least 2-3 sentences)
- Check AI provider status
- Try again with different selection

### Generated cards are low quality
**Solutions:**
- Edit and refine cards manually before indexing
- Improve source note quality (clearer writing)
- Try different AI provider (Claude often better for educational content)
- Adjust selection (focus on key concepts)

### Cards not indexed after generation
**Remember:** AI generation only creates the text in your note. You must:
1. Save the note
2. Press `Cmd+Shift+F` to index flashcards
3. Then `Cmd+Shift+R` to start reviewing
