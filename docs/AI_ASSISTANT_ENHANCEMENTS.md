# AI Assistant Enhancements - PKM-Specific Features

## Overview

The AI Assistant has been enhanced with powerful PKM (Personal Knowledge Management) specific features that make it uniquely valuable for MarkItUp users. Instead of just being another chatbot, it now deeply integrates with your knowledge base to provide proactive assistance.

## üöÄ What's New

### Quick Commands

The AI Assistant now supports slash commands for instant PKM operations:

#### `/connections` or `/connect`
**Find related notes based on content similarity**

```
Usage: /connections
```

- Analyzes the current note's content
- Scans your entire knowledge base for connections
- Returns top 5 related notes with confidence scores
- Explains why each connection is relevant

**Example Output:**
```markdown

- Uses context from your current note

**Example:**
```
Input: /expand Machine learning is a subset of AI

Output:
‚ú® Expanding your content...

**Expanded Version:**

Machine learning represents a significant subset of artificial intelligence 
that focuses on enabling systems to learn and improve from experience without 
being explicitly programmed. Unlike traditional AI approaches that rely on 
rule-based programming, machine learning algorithms build mathematical models 
based on sample data, known as training data, to make predictions or decisions.

This approach has revolutionized how we tackle complex problems where defining 
explicit rules would be impractical or impossible. For instance, teaching a 
computer to recognize images of cats by describing all possible features would 
be nearly impossible, but machine learning can learn these patterns from 
thousands of example images.

The field encompasses various techniques including supervised learning, 
unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, each suited to different 
types of problems and data availability.

üí° *Copy this expanded text to your note.*
```

#### `/summarize` or `/summary`
**Summarize current note**

```
Usage: /summarize
```

- Creates a concise summary of your note
- Highlights key points and main ideas
- Useful for quick reviews or creating note previews
- Structured in 2-3 clear paragraphs

**Example Output:**
```markdown
üìù Creating summary...

**Summary:**

This note explores React Hooks, a feature introduced in React 16.8 that allows 
you to use state and other React features without writing class components. The 
primary hooks discussed are useState for managing component state and useEffect 
for handling side effects like data fetching and subscriptions.

The key advantage of hooks is that they let you reuse stateful logic between 
components without changing your component hierarchy. This solves the problems 
of wrapper hell and makes code more readable. The note includes practical 
examples of converting class components to functional components using hooks.

Common patterns covered include custom hooks for shared logic, the rules of 
hooks (only call at top level, only call from React functions), and best 
practices for dependency arrays in useEffect to avoid infinite loops and stale 
closures.
```

#### `/help` or `/?`
**Show available commands**

```
Usage: /help
```

Displays a complete list of available commands with descriptions.

## üéØ Key Benefits

5. **Use `/expand` for first drafts** - Turn bullet points into full paragraphs

### Workflow Examples

#### **Organizing a New Note**
```
1. Write your rough draft
2. Run /tag to get tag suggestions
3. Run /link to find connection opportunities
4. Add the suggested wikilinks
5. Run /connections to see what else is related
```

#### **Deep Research Session**
```
1. Review existing note on topic
2. Run /gaps to identify what's missing
3. Research the identified gaps
4. Use /expand to develop brief notes into full sections
5. Run /connections to link to related work
```

#### **Knowledge Base Maintenance**
```
1. Open an old note
2. Run /connections to find new relationships
3. Use /link to suggest modern connections
4. Run /tag to update tags based on current system
5. Use /summarize to add a note preview
```

## üîß Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **File Access**: Commands read notes from the `/markdown` directory
2. **AI Processing**: Uses your configured AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, or Ollama)
3. **Context Building**: Automatically includes relevant context for better results
4. **JSON Responses**: AI returns structured data that's formatted nicely for display

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "No note is currently open"
- Make sure you have a markdown file open in the editor
- The current note ID must be passed to the AI Chat component

### "AI provider not configured"
- Go to AI Settings (gear icon in chat)
- Enter your API key for OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini
- Or configure Ollama URL for local AI

### "Failed to find connections"
- Ensure you have multiple notes in your knowledge base
- Check that your AI provider API key is valid
- Try a simpler command first to verify setup

### Commands are slow
- This is normal - AI processing takes 2-5 seconds
- Consider switching to GPT-3.5 Turbo for faster responses
- Ollama responses depend on your hardware

### Commands return empty results
- You may not have enough notes for connections/gaps analysis
- Try commands with different notes
- Ensure note has sufficient content (>100 words recommended)
