# UI Enhancements TODO

This document lists potential UI enhancements for the MarkItUp application.

## 1. Improved Theme Customization
- Add more theme options (e.g., sepia, solarized) and allow users to preview themes before applying.
- Provide a theme settings panel for fine-tuning font size, line height, and color accents.

## 2. Enhanced Markdown Preview
- Add side-by-side split view with synchronized scrolling between editor and preview.
- Support for rendering diagrams (e.g., Mermaid, PlantUML) and LaTeX math blocks.
- Add a "copy as HTML" button for the rendered preview.

## 3. File Management UI
- Implement drag-and-drop for reordering files/folders in the sidebar.
- Add context menus (right-click) for file actions (rename, duplicate, delete).
- Show file icons based on file type.

## 4. Editor Experience
- Add a command palette (if not present) for quick actions (open file, switch theme, etc.).
- Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions (save, new file, toggle preview).
- Add a minimap or outline for large markdown files.

## 5. Accessibility & Responsiveness
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible and have proper ARIA labels.
- Improve mobile and tablet responsiveness, especially for the sidebar and editor.

## 6. Notifications & Feedback
- Add toast notifications for file operations (save, delete, error).
- Show loading indicators for long-running actions (e.g., file load, theme switch).

## 7. Plugin/Extension UI
- If plugins are supported, provide a plugin marketplace UI with install/uninstall and settings management.
