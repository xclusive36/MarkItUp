## 🐳 Quick Deploy

### Docker Compose (Recommended)

**⚠️ REQUIRED: Generate secure secrets before deploying:**

```bash
# Generate JWT_SECRET
openssl rand -base64 32

# Generate ENCRYPTION_KEY
openssl rand -hex 16
```

**Create `docker-compose.yml`:**

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  markitup:
    container_name: markitup
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    # volumes:
      # Optional: Uncomment to persist markdown files on host filesystem
      # Note: Requires chmod 777 ./markdown for write permissions
      # For managed hosting or ephemeral deployments, leave commented
      # - ./markdown:/app/markdown
    environment:
      - PORT=3000
      - HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0
      - NODE_ENV=production
      # REQUIRED: Replace with your generated secrets
      - JWT_SECRET=your-generated-jwt-secret-here
      - ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-generated-encryption-key-here
      # Optional: Disable auth for testing (NOT FOR PRODUCTION)
      # - DISABLE_AUTH=false
    restart: unless-stopped
    image: ghcr.io/xclusive36/markitup:latest
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Docker CLI

```bash
# Generate secrets
JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 16)

# Run without persistent storage (default)
docker run --name markitup -p 3000:3000 \
  -e JWT_SECRET="$JWT_SECRET" \
  -e ENCRYPTION_KEY="$ENCRYPTION_KEY" \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/xclusive36/markitup:latest

# OR with persistent storage
docker run --name markitup -p 3000:3000 \
  -v ./markdown:/app/markdown \
  -e JWT_SECRET="$JWT_SECRET" \
  -e ENCRYPTION_KEY="$ENCRYPTION_KEY" \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/xclusive36/markitup:latest
```

### 📦 Data Persistence (Optional)

By default, data lives in the container. To persist data on your host:

1. **Uncomment the volume mount** in docker-compose.yml or add `-v ./markdown:/app/markdown` to docker run
2. **Set permissions:**

```bash
# Easy method (all users can write)
chmod -R 777 ./markdown

# Secure method (container user only)
sudo chown -R 1001:1001 ./markdown
```

> For managed hosting, skip volume mounts and implement alternative storage (S3, database, etc.)

## 🔐 Authentication Configuration

MarkItUp supports both **multi-user authenticated mode** (default, recommended) and **single-user unauthenticated mode** for personal self-hosted deployments.

### Default: Multi-User Mode (Recommended)

**Features:**

- ✅ Secure user isolation - each user has their own `/markdown/user_{id}/` directory
- ✅ User management with signup, login, and session handling
- ✅ Per-user quotas and usage tracking
- ✅ Audit logs showing who modified what
- ✅ Collaborative features (sharing, permissions)

**Requirements:**

- Set `JWT_SECRET` and `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variables
- Users must sign up and log in

### Single-User Mode (DISABLE_AUTH=true)

For personal self-hosted instances where you're the only user:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
environment:
  - DISABLE_AUTH=true
```

**What This Does:**

- ✅ No signup/login required - instant access
- ✅ All files stored in `/markdown/` root directory
- ✅ Simpler setup for single-user scenarios
- ⚠️ **No user isolation** - all data is shared
- ⚠️ **No access control** - anyone with network access can read/write
- ⚠️ **No audit trail** - can't track who changed what
- ⚠️ **Limited features** - collaboration and sharing disabled

**⚠️ SECURITY WARNINGS:**

```text
🚨 DISABLE_AUTH=true means:
   • Anyone who can reach your server can access ALL your notes
   • No password protection whatsoever
   • No way to restrict who can create, edit, or delete files
   • All AI Chat file operations affect the shared directory
   • Should ONLY be used for:
     - Personal single-user deployments
     - Localhost-only access
     - Development/testing
     - Networks you completely trust
```

**When to Use Each Mode:**

| Scenario | Recommended Mode |
|----------|-----------------|
| Personal use, only you access it | Either (DISABLE_AUTH is fine) |
| Exposing to the internet | **Multi-user ONLY** |
| Sharing with family/team | **Multi-user ONLY** |
| Untrusted network | **Multi-user ONLY** |
| Development/testing | DISABLE_AUTH is convenient |

**Best Practices for DISABLE_AUTH=true:**

1. **Network Isolation:** Only expose on localhost or trusted LAN
2. **Firewall Rules:** Block external access at network level
3. **Reverse Proxy:** Use nginx/Caddy with basic auth if internet-facing
4. **Regular Backups:** No audit log means you can't recover from mistakes
5. **Single User Only:** Never use for multi-user scenarios

**Migration:** You can switch between modes anytime. Existing data in `/markdown/` will work in both modes, though user-specific folders (`/markdown/user_*/`) are only used in multi-user mode.
