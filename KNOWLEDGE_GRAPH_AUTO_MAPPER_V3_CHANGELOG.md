## üí° Usage Examples

### Example 1: Undo Workflow

```typescript
// Discover connections
await plugin.discoverConnections();
// Shows 10 suggestions

// Apply first connection
await plugin.applyConnection(suggestions[0]);
// ‚úì Applied successfully

// Realize it was wrong
await plugin.undoLastAction();
// ‚úì Undone - note restored to previous state

// History now has 0 items (undo consumed the action)
```

### Example 2: Analytics Workflow

```typescript
// Run analysis after working for a week
await plugin.showAnalyticsDashboard();

// Dashboard shows:
// - Health Score: 85% (Excellent)
// - 42 connections made this week
// - Growth rate: +65%
// - Top note: "Machine Learning.md" (12 connections)

// Click recommendation button
onConnectOrphans(); // Automatically suggests orphan connections
```

### Example 3: Export/Import Workflow

```typescript
// After discovering many connections
await plugin.discoverConnections();
// 25 suggestions found

// Export for review
await plugin.exportSuggestions();
// Downloads: graph-suggestions-2025-10-16.json

// Later, on different machine
await plugin.importSuggestions();
// Loads all 25 suggestions back
// Can now apply them in bulk
```

### Example 4: Graph Visualization

```typescript
// Discover connections
await plugin.discoverConnections();

// Graph view automatically updates:
// - Dashed green lines for high-confidence (85%+)
// - Dashed yellow lines for medium (75%)
// - Dashed orange lines for low (65%)

// User hovers over dashed line:
// Tooltip shows: "Related content: Both discuss neural networks"

// User clicks dashed line:
// Connection applied immediately
// Line becomes solid
```
