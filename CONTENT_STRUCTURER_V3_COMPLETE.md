## 💡 Key Insights

### **What Worked Well:**

2. 🎯 Structure analysis is **more valuable** than content generation
3. 🔄 **Bidirectional transformations** (outline ↔ narrative) are powerful
4. 🎓 **Academic mode** as a toggle is cleaner than separate plugin

### **What's Unique:**
1. 🌟 **Only PKM tool** with integrated structure analysis
2. 🌟 **Most comprehensive** content transformation system
3. 🌟 **Better than AI chat** because it understands document context
4. 🌟 **Complements writing** instead of replacing it
