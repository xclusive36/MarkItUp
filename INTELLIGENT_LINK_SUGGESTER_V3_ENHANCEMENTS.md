### 2. 🔧 Plugin Core Enhancements

#### **New Features Added:**

1. **Pattern Learning System**
   - Tracks user accept/reject decisions
   - Stores learning data in localStorage
   - Automatically adjusts confidence thresholds based on user behavior
   - Filters out repeatedly rejected suggestions
   - New setting: `enable-learning` (default: true)

2. **Link Preview System**
   - Shows first 500 characters of linked note
   - Async loading with loading state
   - Toggle preview on/off
   - Integrated into LinkSuggestionsPanel

3. **Individual Accept/Reject**
   - No more all-or-nothing approach
   - Track decision for each suggestion
   - Visual feedback (accepted/rejected counts)
   - Learning from patterns

4. **No Console Output**
   - ❌ Removed all `console.log()` statements for user-facing output
   - ✅ All output now goes through professional UI components
   - ✅ Only error/debugging console.logs remain (for developers)

5. **Modal-Based UI Integration**
   - Uses `api.ui.showModal()` for displaying panels
   - Proper React component rendering
   - Clean unmounting on close
   - Multiple panel types (links, bridge, map)

### 3. 📊 Learning Algorithm Details

**How It Works:**
```typescript
// Track decisions
acceptedLinks: [{ source, target, confidence }]
rejectedLinks: [{ source, target, confidence }]

// Learn patterns
minAcceptedConfidence = min(acceptedLinks.confidence)
maxRejectedConfidence = max(rejectedLinks.confidence)

// Apply learning
if (suggestion repeatedly rejected) {
  filter out from future suggestions
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces irrelevant suggestions over time
- Adapts to user's linking style
- Privacy-focused (stored locally)
- Configurable (can be disabled)

### 4. 🎯 UI/UX Improvements

#### Before v3.0:
```javascript
console.log(`Found ${suggestions.length} opportunities`);
console.log(formattedMessage);
// User must check console
```

#### After v3.0:
```javascript
showPanel('links', {
  suggestions,
  onAccept: (s) => acceptSuggestion(s),
  onReject: (s) => rejectSuggestion(s),
  on Preview: (id) => getPreviewContent(id)
});
// Beautiful modal with interactive controls
```

### 5. 📋 Settings Updates

**New Settings Added:**
- **Enable Pattern Learning** (boolean, default: true)
  - Learn from accept/reject patterns
  - Improve future suggestions

**Updated Settings:**
- All settings now have clearer descriptions
- Version bumped to 3.0.0

### 6. 🔄 Command Behavior Changes

| Command | Old Behavior | New Behavior |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Find Link Opportunities | Console output | Interactive modal with accept/reject |
| Scan All Notes | Console summary | Progress notifications + summary |
| Show Connection Map | Console text | Visual dashboard with metrics |
| Suggest Bridge Note | Console output | Beautiful suggestion panel |
